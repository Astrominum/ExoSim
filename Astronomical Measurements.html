<h1>Astronomical Measurements</h1>
<ul>
<li><h3>Solar Mass (M<sub>☉</sub>)    </h3><p>A unit of mass equal to the mass of the Sun, typically used in comparison to stars.</p></li>
<li><h3>Jovian Mass (M<sub>J</sub>)    </h3><p>A unit of mass equal to the mass of Jupiter, typically used in comparison to large planets.</p></li>
<li><h3>Earth Mass (M<sub>⨁</sub>)    </h3><p>A unit of mass equal to the mass of Earth, typically used in comparison to small or medium-sized planets.</p></li>
<li><h3>Solar Radii (R<sub>☉</sub>)    </h3><p>A unit of distance equal to the radius of the Sun, typically used in comparison to stars.</p></li>
<li><h3>Jovian Radii (R <sub>J</sub>)    </h3><p>A unit of distance equal to the radius of Jupiter, typically used in comparison to large planets.</p></li>
<li><h3>Earth Radii (R<sub>⨁</sub>)    </h3><p>A unit of distance equal to the radius of the Sun, typically used in comparison to large planets.</p></li>
<li><h3>Lightyear    </h3><p>A unit of distance equal to how far light travels in a year, typically used to measure extents between objects and places in the Universe.</p></li>
<li><h3>Astronomical Unit (AU)    </h3><p>A unit of distance equal to distance between Earth and the Sun, typically used to measure extents between planets and their star in exoplanetary systems.</p></li>
<li><h3>Absolute Magnitude    </h3><p>A unit of luminosity measured in how bright an astronomical object looks from Earth, typically used with stars.</p>  <li><h3>Kelvin (K)    </h3><p>A unit of temperature equal to 273.15 degrees more than Celsius, typically used to measure the heat of stars. Kelvin is directly based off of molecular motion, with 0 Kelvin being an impossible point of no particle movement. </p></li>
