<h1>Neutron Star</h1>
<h2>A type of star that are miniscule, bright and burning by star standards. They typically have a mass of 4.8 × 10²⁷, an average surface temperature of almost 2 million degreese celsius, and a diameter of 12 miles. Neutron stars are a fascinating subject as they are so small, however so dense and hot. One interesting thing about them is that they have something called "Strange Matter" at their core, possibly interacting as a sixth state of matter that has interesting and destrutctive properties. Another fact about them, is that when they collapse, they transform into a black hole.</h2>
