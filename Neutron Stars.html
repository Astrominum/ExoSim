<h1>Neutron Star</h1>
<h2>A type of star that are miniscule, bright and burning by star standards. They typically have a mass of 4.4 × 10²⁷ metric tons, an average surface temperature of almost 2 million kelvin, and a diameter of 20 kilometers. Neutron stars are a fascinating subject as they are so small, however so dense and hot. Another fact about them, is that when they collapse, they transform into a black hole.</h2>
