<h1>What is an Exoplanet?</h1>
<p>An exoplanet is a large celestial body that orbits around a star. It is different than a planet, as exoplanets are defined as planets outside our solar system. The idea of exoplanets was popularized in 1917, but the first one wasn't discovered until 1992. As of 2025, there have been 5,000+ exoplanets discovered.</p>
