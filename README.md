# ExoSim
ExoSim is a exoplanertary system website using CSS and HTML and the <a href="https://www.piskelapp.com">piskel.app</a> pixel art software for art. We use NASA Exoplanet Exploration's software, <a href="https://exoplanets.nasa.gov/eyes-on-exoplanets/#/">Eyes on Exoplanets</a> for accurate however not full-proof stats. To use the website, either go to <a href="https://developer029.github.io/ExoSim">our Github</a> or download the zip file, extract it, and click index.html.

Sincerely, the devs
